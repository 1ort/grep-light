# grep-light

`grep-light` is a minimalistic command-line tool written in Rust, inspired by the classic `grep` utility. It allows you to search for patterns in files or standard input, making it a simple yet effective tool for text search tasks. This project was created as an exercise from the book "Rust in Action" by Tim McNamara (timClicks).

## Features

- **Pattern Search**: Search for a specified pattern in a file or standard input.
- **Minimalistic**: A lightweight and straightforward implementation of the `grep` functionality.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple command-line interface with intuitive options.

## Usage

```bash
grep-light <pattern> [input]
```

### Flags

- `-h, --help`: Prints help information.
- `-V, --version`: Prints version information.

### Arguments

- `<pattern>`: The pattern to search for.
- `<input>`: The file to search in. If not provided, `grep-light` will read from standard input.

### Example

To search for the pattern "hello" in a file named `example.txt`:

```bash
grep-light hello example.txt
```

To search for the pattern "world" in the standard input:

```bash
echo "hello world" | grep-light world
```

## Installation

   ```

3. Build and run the project using Cargo:

   ```bash
   cargo run -- <pattern> [input]
   ```
